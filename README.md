# weather_clone

Flutter Weather app clone.

## Info

State management solution: GetX;
Translation: GetX;

I didn't use https://app.quicktype.io to make models. Instead I've downloaded the following package and edited it to work specifically for my app: https://pub.dev/packages/weather

For caching weather data I used Shared Preferences and for weather icons I've used the following package: https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image

Tested on both iOS and Android
